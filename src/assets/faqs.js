            question: "How would you describe your photography style?",
            answer: "My style is cinematic and portrait-focused, with a relaxed approach that avoids anything too posed or awkward. I want you to feel comfortable and have a fun experience; all while capturing stunning images that you'll love."

            question: "How do I book a photography session?",
            answer: "You can book a session by visiting our contact page and filling out the booking form, or you can message us on Facebook."
        },
        {
            id: "faq3",
            question: "Where will the session take place?",
            answer: "The session can be anywhere you like, although I will casually chat with you and work out what would be best. Typically, I work within Tokyo, but if you prefer two or more locations, or areas outside Tokyo like Yokohama or within Kanagawa, you’ll need to cover transportation costs."
        },
        {
            id: "faq4",
            question: "What should I wear for the session?",
            answer: `For spring and summer, I suggest going for soft, muted colors like denims, blues, creams, and pastels. These shades work beautifully with natural settings and suit most skin tones. Try to steer clear of bright primary colors, black, and bold patterns/stripes if possible, as they can be a bit distracting.

            For autumn and winter, dark neutrals with green or burgundy, mustard and rust with browns, and deep jewel tones work well. Light neutrals with navy blue or cranberry are also good choices. Skip formal wear and opt for layers and textures like chunky knits and scarves. Patterns can be nice too.
            
            If you’re unsure, feel free to share snapshots of your clothing with me, or bring a few options to the session.

            id: "faq5",
            question: "How long will it take to receive the photos?",
            answer: "My standard turnaround time for photos is within 5-7 days. Although during peak seasons like spring and autumn, it may take up to 2 weeks. Just let me know if you need them sooner, and I’ll adjust the price accordingly."
        },
        {
            id: "faq6",
            question: "How will the photos be delivered to me?",
            answer:"I’ll upload your photos to Google Drive in high quality. You’ll have 2 weeks to download them at your convenience."
        },
        {
            id: "faq7",
            question: "Can we have the unedited/RAW files?",
            answer: "Sorry, but I don’t provide RAW or unedited photos. These files do not reflect the final quality of my work, and don’t show the final look I aim to achieve. I only offer beautifully edited, finished images that look their best."
        },
        {
            id: "faq8",
            question: "How long do you keep galleries backed up?",
            answer: "I keep galleries backed up on my computer for 3 months. Due to large number of files, I recommend downloading and securely saving your images (from Google Drive) within 2 weeks. After this period, online galleries cannot be uploaded, and I cannot take responsibility for storing your photos. Please make sure to back them up in time."
        },
        {
            id: "faq9",
            question: "What happens if I show up late?",
            answer: `I recommend arriving 10-15 minutes early to avoid any issues. If you're running late, please text or call. The shoot will start when you arrive at the location and use the remaining time from your booking.`
        },
        {
            id: "faq10",
            question: "What happens if we can’t make it to the scheduled shoot because of bad weather or illness?",
            answer: `If the weather is rainy, I’d be delighted to reschedule the shoot. I keep a close eye on the forecast and will reach out a few days ahead if we need to adjust our plans.

            In case of illness, please inform me at least 24 hours in advance, and we’ll arrange a new time that works for both of us. Keep in mind that rescheduling will depend on my availability, given other bookings.`
        },
        {
            id: "faq11",
            question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
            answer: `To save date, a 30% deposit is required. If you need to cancel because of heavy rain or illness, just let me know at least 24 hours ahead so we can reschedule, depending on availability. For the best chance of finding a new time, please try to avoid waiting until the last minute. Just a friendly reminder: if the final payment isn’t made, the deposit will be forfeited and cannot be refunded.`
